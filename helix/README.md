# helix  config
## right WASD
in game, WASD is movement keys.
in vim, hjkl is movement keys.

---
my keyboard typing uses 3 fingers, not 4 fingers correspomding hjkl.
not uses 4, vim default key binding for movement is difficult for me.
repeat trying, but cannot use 4.

in past, played MMORPG in PC and used wasd to move.
it is fited for me and now, fit for me.
it is 3 finger move method.

so set right WASD in helix keymap config.

key string on keymap implies its mean.
insert mode bind, i, is imply insert by the initial alphabet.
but locate and locate key string, key string exhaust and cannot allocate mean to key string.

therefore, ignore key string imply completely, partialy consider, and locate key string fo keymap.
